so, I did not finish the project, or at least not in the way that I intended, things that are missing:
	images don't load despite the src reciving the url.
	when adding new itens it doesn't generate new itens, just un-hidden the ones I've created, and when it asks to show even more, it just updates te bottom 8 to those of the new page.
	none of the buttons have any link (i did want to put some)
i was wanting to generate new items as the client presses the add more items button, but i didn't remember how to do it, but the layout suports it (it doens't overlap) and the .js file would have to get a minor change on its getJSON() function to load properly.
